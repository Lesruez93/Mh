                       </h2>
                       <p class="text-white padding2">
                           My name is Theodora Marais, I'm 22 years old and I'm French: from Lille to the north of France!
                           I come from a cosmopolitan family, turned towards the international, by a double culture of my two parents,
                           Franco Bresiliene by my father
                           and Beninese Senegalo by my mother. I speak the two mother tongues of my mother.
                           I go to Senegal regularly since the age of 5 in my maternal family.
                           I am preparing a Master of Political Science at the University of Lille.
                           My studies allowed me to travel in Europe: Germany, Austria, Portugal.
                           I like to study and practice foreign languages: English, German and Portuguese.
                           In parallel with my studies, I am an animator with children.
                           I like to share moments with them to help them. Education is a major issue that concerns the whole of society.
                           At 17 years old I decided to pass my certificate of aptitude to the functions of animator (BAFA).
                           It allows me to get involved in educational projects.
                           I like the arts of the scene, the artistic expression: the theater, the song, the dance and the music.
                           My parents gave me the curiosity and the passion to discover our history.
                           During my free time, I like visiting museums and historical sites in France and abroad.
                           I am also involved as a volunteer in Lille association:
                           Ephatha is an association that helps locals come to share meals and dress cheaply.
                           the association also works for the alphabetization.
                           I am proud and happy to be named Miss Heritage Global!
                           It is a challenge that honors me and is in perfect coherence with my ambitions and my life projects!
